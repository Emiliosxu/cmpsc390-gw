shopping features and subscription feature

As a user, I want to be able to securely and reliably buy clothes. I am looking into using an external api to set up the ability to sell and buy items. This feature is useful because as a user I want to be able to securely and reliably buy clothes. This will involve touching ui, backend, and database layers. Ill have to design the cart and checkout layouts, and connect the front end to the database through backend logic. I will also be working on a subscription feature. This feature will allow designers to access business analytics tools.

1. Problem Statement
Shopping features solves our current problem of not having the ability to buy listings yet. The subscriptions feature allows us to see how to provide our premium tools too.

2. User Flow
The user will look at designer listings and either add to cart or click checkout with that one item. Then user will then be able to fill in shipping and payment information. Lastly, they will receive a tacking code.

3.tech plan
to set up the shopping feature I will first use html to set up a checkout and add to cart features
I will then use a service like shopify to add a secure way to buy things. I will use node.js to connect the buy feature to the available listing found in the database. Files expected to be modify include our homepage and register files.


I will be done when users can securely buy listings and Designers can gain access business analytics tool when subscription set.
