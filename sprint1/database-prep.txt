1. What you are responsible for in Sprint 1
• I own Turn the schema into tables and insert test data
• Rami owns Convert ER diagram into relational schema and write core queries for feature 1

2. Setup steps
I will need to install the MySQL package
• I need to create tables and insert data into each table created from the relational schema
• The image of the schema is in the main branch that the tables will be made from

3. Development plan
• Cards for this sprint would look like setting up the basics for the database like creating the ER diagram and turning it into a schema, which is already done, then turning that schema into tables with data, and then finally creating queries to test our first main feature.
• I would need to create the files for the actual data in the data tables in the database which would be sql code and files. Which can be edited at anytime.
• Being done would look like their being data in all of the tables.

4. Risks or questions
• Mistakes can be what type of the data is entered if its not the correct data type
• Since me and Rami are splitting it up we each need to do our parts so we can combine it
